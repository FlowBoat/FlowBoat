              FlowBoat is an institution where bright young minds come together to be creative with science and technology.
              FlowBoat students and members participate in a variety of programs which challenge their skills in: physics,
              computer science, business, environmental sustainability and anything the team wants to tackle. Built from the
              ground up for high school students, FlowBoat is designed to provide today's youth with the experience they need
              to tackle the problems of tomorrow. Using data science, FlowBoat's crew of diverse students from all across Waterloo
              Region are able to design solutions with meaningful impact. This year, FlowBoat had 96 applicants, twenty of whom
              were selected to join the crew and power our 4 startup ventures. Next year we'll be looking to expand to accommodate
              even more students who can show that they have our FlowBoat spark.
              A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart.
